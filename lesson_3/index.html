					<span class="name">PlayStation</span> The (abbreviated as PS, commonly known as the PS1/PS one or its codename PSX) is a home video game
					console developed and marketed by <a target="_blank" href="https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Interactive_Entertainment">Sony Interactive
						Entertainment</a>. It was released in Japan on 3 December 1994, in North
					America on 9 September 1995, in Europe on 29 September 1995, and in Australia on 15 November 1995. As a fifth-generation
					console, the PlayStation primarily competed with the Nintendo 64 and the Sega Saturn.
				</p>
				<p>
					Sony began developing the PlayStation after a failed venture with Nintendo to create a CD-ROM peripheral for the Super
					Nintendo Entertainment System in the early 1990s. The console was primarily designed by Ken Kutaragi and Sony Computer
					Entertainment in Japan, while additional development was outsourced in the United Kingdom.

				The main microprocessor is a 32-bit LSI R3000 CPU with a clock rate of 33.86 MHz and 30 MIPS.[135][136] Its CPU relies
				heavily on the "cop2" 3D and matrix math coprocessor on the same die to provide the necessary speed to render complex 3D
				graphics.[25] The role of the separate GPU chip is to draw 2D polygons and apply shading and textures to them: the
				rasterisation stage of the graphics pipeline. Sony's custom 16-bit sound chip supports ADPCM sources with up to 24 sound
				channels and offers a sampling rate of up to 44.1 kHz and MIDI sequencing. It features 2 MB of main RAM, with an
				additional 1 MB being allocated to video memory.[137][138] The PlayStation has a maximum colour depth of 16.7 million
				true colours[139] with 32 levels of transparency and unlimited colour look-up tables. Its video output, initially
				provided by a parallel I/O cable (and later a serial I/O used for the PlayStation Link Cable) displays resolutions from
				256×224 to 640×480 pixels.

				Functionality
			</h2>
			<p class="paragraph">
				In addition to playing games, most PlayStation models are equipped to play audio CDs; the Asian model SCPH-5903 can also
				play Video CDs.[175] Like most CD players, the PlayStation can play songs in a programmed order, shuffle the playback
				order of the disc and repeat one song or the entire disc. Later PlayStation models use a music visualisation function
				called SoundScope. This function, as well as a memory card manager, is accessed by starting the console without either
				inserting a game or closing the CD tray, thereby accessing a graphical user interface (GUI) for the PlayStation
				BIOS.[27] The GUI for the PS One and PlayStation differ depending on the firmware version: the original PlayStation GUI
				had a dark blue background with rainbow graffiti used as buttons, while the early PAL PlayStation and PS One GUI had a
				grey blocked background with two icons in the middle.

				Game library
			</h2>
			<p>
				he PlayStation featured a diverse game library which grew to appeal to all types of players. The first two games
				available at launch were Jumping Flash! (1995) and Ridge Racer,[190][191] with Jumping Flash! heralded as an ancestor
				for 3D graphics in console gaming.[192] Critically acclaimed PlayStation games included Final Fantasy VII (1997), Crash
				Bandicoot (1996), Spyro the Dragon (1998), Metal Gear Solid (1998), all of which became established franchises. Final
				Fantasy VII is credited with allowing role-playing games to gain mass-market appeal outside Japan,[193] and is
				considered one of the most influential and greatest video games ever made.

				SCE was an upstart in the video game industry in late 1994, as the video game market in the early 1990s was dominated by
				Nintendo and Sega. Nintendo had been the clear leader in the industry since the introduction of the Nintendo
				Entertainment System in 1985 and the Nintendo 64 was initially expected to maintain this position. The PlayStation's
				target audience included the generation which was the first to grow up with mainstream video games, along with 18- to
				29-year-olds who were not the primary focus of Nintendo.[205] By the late 1990s, Sony became a highly regarded console
				brand due to the PlayStation, with a significant lead over second-place Nintendo, while Sega was relegated to a distant
				third.[206]
