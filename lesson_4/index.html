					<span class="name">Kingdom Come: Deliverance</span> is a 2018 action role-playing video game developed and published by <a class="link" target="_blank"
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warhorse_Studios">Warhorse Studios</a> and co-published by Deep Silver for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. It is set in the medieval Kingdom of
						Bohemia, an Imperial State of the Holy Roman Empire, with a focus on historically accurate content.[
				</p>
				<p>
					The story takes place during a war in Bohemia in 1403, in the times of King Wenceslaus IV. On the orders of Hungarian
					king Sigismund, half-brother of Wenceslaus, Cuman mercenaries raid the mining village of Skalitz, a major source of
					silver. One of the survivors of the resulting massacre is Henry, the son of a blacksmith. Destitute and vengeful, Henry
					joins the service of Lord Radzig Kobyla, who leads a resistance movement against Sigismund's invasion. As Henry pursues
					justice for his murdered family, he becomes involved in an effort to restore Bohemia's rightful king and Sigismund's
					half-brother, Wenceslaus IV, to the throne.

				Gameplay
			</h2>
			<p>
				Kingdom Come: Deliverance is an action role-playing game set in an open-world environment and played from a first-person
				perspective. It utilizes a classless role-playing system, allowing the player to customize their skills to take on roles
				such as warrior, bard, thief, or a hybrid of these. Abilities and stats grow depending on what the player does and says
				through branched dialogue trees. During conversations, the time a player takes to make a decision is limited and has an
				effect on their relationships with others. Reputation is based on player choices and therefore can bring
				consequences.[2]
				
				Character bodies and faces are created through the combination of multiple, individual pieces with finishing touches.
				The clothing system features 16 item slots and items on many areas of the body that can be layered.[1] For example, a
				heavily armored knight may on his upper body wear a gambeson, followed by mail and plate armour, with a tabard or
				surcoat over top, for a total of four clothing items in the chest slots. Each clothing type provides different levels of
				protection against different types of weapons. Clothing also gets progressively more worn, dirty, or bloody through use,
				affecting the character's appearance. The player is able to use a variety of weapons, including swords, knives, axes,
				hammers, and bows.[3] Horses are featured heavily in the game, and are designed to act with their own AI while under the
				player's control, moving or jumping to avoid small obstacles or dangers. The player can also fight from horseback and
				use their steed to carry items if they need additional inventory space, but warhorses are also competent combatants with
				their own AI. Steeds come with five slots for armor and attachments.

				Development
			</h2>
			<p>
				The project that was to become Kingdom Come: Deliverance began with a pitch by Daniel Vávra, who had left 2K Czech in
				2009. With a small team he began seeking investors for the project. Vávra's pitch brought on board Martin Klíma, founder
				of Altar Games, but pitches to major investors in the Czech Republic were not successful. The team was preparing to
				abandon the project when a successful pitch to a private investor, the Czech billionaire Zdeněk Bakala, secured funding
				to develop a prototype of the game. Warhorse Studios was founded on 21 July 2011.[8]
				
				Warhorse Studios first announced that they were working on an "unannounced role-playing game" on 9 February 2012, having
				successfully licensed CryEngine 3 on this date.[9] After seventeen months working on the prototype, Warhorse began a
				tour pitching the prototype to various international investors. The project did not generate the hype they had hoped for
				and, with dwindling resources, little progress was made towards an investment.[

				Although historians commended the game for aiming for historical accuracy,[39][40] several commentators and scholars
				have criticised the developers' overwhelmingly white portrayal of fifteenth century Central Europe and of Cumans and
				Hungarians as cruel invaders.[41][42][39] The developers responded by saying that the game was historically accurate and
				that people of color did not inhabit early 15th-century Bohemia in significant numbers.[43] One researcher attempted to
				evaluate the game's historical accuracy with respect to medieval life. He found that many aspects of material reality,
				including melee weapons, armor, and food, were accurate to medieval sources. However, he noted that the lack of
				crossbows and firearms was anachronistic, and that the Cumans would not have been Hungarian-speaking "barbaric" nomads
				with outdated gear as they are depicted in the game.

				On release day, the game topped the Steam top-sellers list.[54] Game director Daniel Vávra stated that the game sold
				500,000 copies during its first two days,[55][56] of which 300,000 were on Steam.[57] Within two weeks of release, the
				game sold over a million copies in total across all platforms.[58] A year after its release the game had sold over 2
				million copies.[59] In June 2020, Warhorse announced that 3 million copies had been sold, with 1.5 million copies of
				additional DLCs.[60] In June 2022, Warhorse announced that over 5 million copies had been sold across all platforms.[21]
				
				The PlayStation 4 version of Kingdom Come: Deliverance sold 13,058 copies within its first week on sale in Japan, which
				placed it at number four on the all-format sales chart.[
